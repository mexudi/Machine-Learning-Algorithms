# Machine Learning Algorithms

In this repo, I will take you through an explanation and implementation of the most common and most used Machine Learning algorithms with Python programming language.

Machine learning algorithms are a set of instructions for a computer on how to interact with, manipulate, and transform data. There are so many types of machine learning algorithms. Selecting the right algorithm is both science and art.
